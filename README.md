Codenvy Extension Scaffolding
=============================

**Codenvy Extension scaffolding template** with the bare minimum files to start development:

- Entry Java package, including Gin module.
- Directory structure for static assets.
- Basic localization files.
- Maven's pom.xml build file.

The extension just prints a message into the running IDE's console. 
The message itself is taken from the localization files.
